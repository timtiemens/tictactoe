## Inspiration

Inspired by the [Kaggle Tic-Tac-Toe End game Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/tictactoe-endgame-dataset-uci).

That Dataset is a 46KB CSV file with 958 rows plus 1 header (959 lines total).
Each row is 10 columns - the 3x3 board plus 1 outcome ("positive" or "negative").

The Dataset self-describes itself as "All possible board configurations at the
end of tic-tac-toe game".
The Dataset information says "About 65.3% are positive (wins for X)",
and that "X is assumed to have played first".

The Dataset was created in 1991 by David W. Aha.
The Dataset is also discussed at [UCI Machine Learning Repository Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame Data Set].


## Issues with the Kaggle Dataset

 * No information provided on how the 958 "endgames" were generated.
 * No independent verification of "958" can be found.
 * Specifically, what about pure duplicates?  i.e. the same game state can
   be generated by multiple games: are these counted?
 * Specifically, many games are symmetrical to one another: are all of 
   these counted?
 * Given the unknowns in the counting, the "65.3% are positive" assertion
   is suspect - 65% is just the number of times "positive" appears in the 
   Dataset (626), divided by the total number of lines (958)
 * It is silly to loose information about the outcomes - "O" winning and 
   "Draw" both have been given the "negative" label.  
    Given up-to-date tools, it is easy to transform
   "X wins", "O wins" and "Draw" into "positive" and "negative" if that is
   what your use requires.

Paper by [Zayd Muhammad Kawakibi Zuhri]

This paper does a fantastic job laying out most of the numbers around 
Tic Tac Toe.  In particular, it provides a double-check on the brute-force
computations below.

## Math

### 255168 Games

Item               | Count   | Percentage
----               |  ----   | ----
Total Games X wins |  131184 |   51% 
Total Games O wins |   77904 |   31% 
Total Games Draws  |   46080 |   18% 
Total Games        |  255168 |  100% 

### 138 fully unique Game States

Item | Expression | Count | Comment
---- | ----       |  ---- |  ---- 
(wrong) Number of Games | 9! |  362880  | naive, overcounts because of "stops"
(correct) Number of Games | | 255168   | see references
(wrong) maximum Game States | 3^9 | 19683 | naive - X,O,blank states for 9 cells
Final Game States   | |  958  |    "reachable", but contains symmetry dupes
Final Game States   | |  138  |    "reachable" and no symmetry dupes


### Percent given 958 Game States

Item                             | Count | Percentage
----                             |  ---- | ----
Total Unique Board States X wins | 626   |  65.34%
Total Unique Board States O wins | 316   |  32.98%
Total Unique Board States Draw   |  16   |  1.67%
Total Games                      | 958   |  100%

### Percent given 138 Game States

Item                             | Count | Percentage
----                             |  ---- | ----
Total Unique Board States X wins |  91   | 65.94%
Total Unique Board States O wins |  44   | 31.88%
Total Unique Board States Draw   |   3   |  2.17%
Total Games                      | 138   | 100%


### Final Board States - Unique - Draw

## Notes

The number of files in build/data/detailsremovedupes is    138.
The total number of lines matches at 958.
Historical only - there were various glitches because at one time only
104 "unique after removing symmetry duplicates" were generated.
It turns out 138 is the correct number of 
"unique after removing symmetry duplicate" game end states.
